-- Executing script file `design_smt2.ys' --

1. Executing RTLIL frontend.
Input filename: design_prep.il

2. Executing HIERARCHY pass (managing design hierarchy).

2.1. Analyzing design hierarchy..
Top module:  \topmsb
Used module:     \topmsb_2
Used module:     \topmsb_1

2.2. Analyzing design hierarchy..
Top module:  \topmsb
Used module:     \topmsb_2
Used module:     \topmsb_1
Removed 0 unused modules.
Module topmsb directly or indirectly contains formal properties -> setting "keep" attribute.

3. Executing FORMALFF pass.

4. Executing DFFUNMAP pass (unmap clock enable and synchronous reset from FFs).

5. Printing statistics.
